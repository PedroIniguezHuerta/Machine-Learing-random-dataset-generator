# Machine-Learing-random-dataset-generator
The following code presents a dataset random generator for machine learning. This tool was created as a solution for the lack of datasets for specific projects.

For instance, sometime ago it was required running machine learning algorithms to differenciate between two classes. 

We already knew the multiple characteristics/parameters of each class but doing the physical measures was a huge task. 

Because of that there were very few measurements available, which were not enough to train machine learnig algorithms.

This tool is a solution for those scenarios, it allows generating huge amounts of measurements easily by running a simple python program from command line.

*Note:*

   This tool is not useful to generate datasets for all projects however it can be used in cases where we know all parameters of each class but need more samples.
